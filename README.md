#LinkedInWin: Stop nagging me to login

I don't use LinkedIn, but I sometimes need to look up a person that only has available information online via LinkedIn.

I find it annoying that LinkedIn requires me to sign up for their service just to view a single LinkedIn page that a user expects others to see. 

So I made a little bookmarklet that hides the nagging modal login screen from linkedin.com and re-enables scroll on the profile page. 

**Solution**  
Make a new bookmark in your browser with the URL address  
found in bookmarklet.js

You should inspect what the small amount of code does in hidenagscreen.js.
